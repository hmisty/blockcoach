# Putin Hits The Pause Button

Bitcoin once dropped from 23.7k to 23.3k overnight, and has now recovered to around 23.7k.

On February 28, Putin signed a law on Russia's suspension of the implementation of the "New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty" signed with the United States. Every broadcast news has been talking about it since yesterday.

The treaty has been extended once and does not expire until 2026. So this is not a non-renewal, but an active suspension.

Russia and the United States jointly own 90% of the world's nuclear warheads. If the two sides continue to fail to effectively manage their differences, the future situation may be unpredictable.

The gods fight, and the imps suffer. The big players fought fiercely with long and short positions, but the losers were small retail investors who followed suit.

Strategic determination is Han Xin's humiliation. But for a tough guy like Putin and Russia's strong national character, even if he knows that the fire in his heart was lit by others, can he swallow this breath?

There is a knife on the heart of the Chinese character “ren” (forbear).

A small leak will sink a great ship. But if there is no plan in mind to move, then it is difficult to judge the trade-offs: which move should be moved like thunder, and which move should be restrained and forbearance.

The same goes for investing. The core essence of the "Ba Zi Jue" is to seek the big and tolerate the small.

Some people say that Biden just wants to force Putin to plant two small mushrooms so that he can cut himself off from the international community.

Maybe it wasn't Biden ferocious. It's the staff around him, all of whom are iron-blooded hawks.

Who I am is not defined by myself, but by the circle of people I live in. If I have had a close relationship with the speculative circle, I will also have a speculative heart. If I walk with long-termists, I am also a long-termist.

The most difficult situation to break is open conspiracy. Show me all the formations, but I just can't find a way to escape.

The water under the lake is stranded.

Life is also in an impenetrable web woven by social and economic relations. Everyone is stuck in it. Everyone cannot be freed.

There is only one way to break the unsolvable situation, and that is to defeat yourself.

The planners calculated me to death, and used me as a pawn in the game. He expects me to do what he expects.

Character determines destiny. The organizers have already figured out my temper.

I wanted to make the planner unexpected, so I broke his game. It meant I got over my character and made decisions I shouldn't have made.

99.99% of people can't do it.

Investing is like practicing. The market wanted to confuse me, but I was unmoved. When I beat myself, I beat the market.
