# Your bull market: Afraid that he will not come, but also afraid that he will act recklessly

The overnight Bitcoin continues to fluctuate around 28,000, with a slight rebound. It swings slowly, sometimes up, sometimes down, making people somewhat itchy in their hearts.

The shyness of being reluctant to rise is like a peony in the morning, with dewdrops hanging on it and buds not yet blooming. And the firmness of what seems to be a drop but not is like a towering cactus covered in thorns, standing tall in the great desert.

30,000 feet is the height a plane climbs above the ground, away from the earth.

30,000 U.S. dollars is where the bamboo shoots break through the ground.

Bamboo takes four years to grow 3 centimeters tall. But starting from the fifth year, it grows 30 to 40 centimeters a day, and can reach 15 meters in just six weeks. What people cannot see is that in the first four seemingly careless years, the root of the bamboo spreads hundreds of square meters underground.

Without rooting deeply in the endless depths of a bear market night, where does the cow market come from, growing crazily at a thousand miles per day?

Some people always shed tears for missing the sun, and in regret and complaint, they miss the stars again.

The joy of autumn harvest can only come from the spring sowing.

Don't complain about this bear market, just like you should not complain about this spring.

Complaining people do not know how to be grateful. They attribute their disappointment to others.

Perhaps when they were children and bumped into a table and fell down, adults would come and console them while pretending to hit the table, saying, "You hit my baby!"

As children who were taught to hit the table when they bumped into it, they learned the mistaken belief of attributing their errors to external factors.

This mistaken belief is deeply buried in their hearts and hidden in their subconscious minds, influencing their lifelong fate.

Infants cannot distinguish themselves from the world. Their logical thinking ability is not enough to distinguish between subject and object. They may mistakenly believe that everything is done according to their own will. When they encounter inconsistent situations, they will cry loudly.

Adults almost never cry as loudly as infants. As they grow older, they gradually realize that there is an external world beyond themselves that does not transfer according to their will.

They know that they cannot completely control the operation of this external world (omnipotent), and they cannot even fully understand how this external world operates (omniscient).

So they reach a compromise with this world.

The more completely a person reconciles with the world, the more thoroughly and clearly they live.

To reconcile with the world is actually to reconcile with one's own heart.

Let go of your attachment and eliminate all suffering.

"Regrets, turned out to be so painful
They will become thin air
And press you out of breath

Where to fly, that can be flown
Itâ€™s a foolish question
I float in the sky, free but powerless."
