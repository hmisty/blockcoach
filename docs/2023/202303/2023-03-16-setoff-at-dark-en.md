# Set Off At Dark

Sometimes, a person, a word, will suddenly arouse infinite ripples in the dull heart.

Maybe it's night, not like morning. After a busy day, I feel exhausted physically and mentally. But at this moment, with a lazy mind, let go of daily defenses.

The ancient city, the dark night, the undefended heart.

I read that Zhang Weiying said that if you set off at dark, and the day gets brighter as you go, everyone will have confidence.

Lightning and flint, such as instant fireworks.

If you walk in a hurry, sometimes you will inevitably be impatient. The more you cling to the goal in front of you, the more often you can't get it. The more busy you are, the more anxious and restless you become. So it got stuck in an unsolved knot.

The darkness of the night gives the soul a chance to stop, rest and contemplate.

I in the morning, don't understand me at the night. Just as dewdrops don't understand the sea, fireflies don't understand big trees, and little boys don't understand mountains.

Life is short, and once halfway through, it begins to pass away day by day. Time is going on like the river flowing away endlessly day and night.

The stars are changing, the sea is dry and the rocks are rotten, and the sea is changing.

Nothing lasts forever, never changes. Even people themselves will change and change, and change again and again.

Sometimes, there are tough decisions to make and stick to them no matter what. Even if many people around me respond with indifference and opposition, I will go despite tens of thousands of people.

People are always people in society. The social network's definition of who himself is more real than himself.

But people are individuals after all, and the pursuit of self is an eternal dream.

If you stop chasing dreams, the soul is gone. A person without a soul turns into an AI machine like ChatGPT. Even if it is possible to imitate the manner and tone so vividly, it even makes the family members who chat over the air feel my eternal life. But that's not me. That could be me in the past, but it definitely won't be me in the future.

Self-seeking is also a process of reconciliation with self.

To reconcile with oneself, we must constantly know ourselves, understand ourselves, and recognize ourselves. Not only to accept their own strengths, but also to accept their own shortcomings and weaknesses.

Shortcomings and weaknesses are just because they have not been able to apply them to the right place. When used in the right place, shortcomings can become advantages, and weaknesses can become strengths.

Do you want to wait until everything is ready before setting off, chasing your dreams, and finding yourself again?

If that's the case, maybe it won't happen in this life. Until entering the grave, still standing at the starting point.

Satoshi Nakamoto said that around 2007, he suddenly figured out how to overcome the Byzantine problem and the FLP impossibility theorem, and realize a practical decentralized currency system.

He didn't first raise funds with a planning scheme, recruit warriors and chariots after finding the money, and then do things with great fanfare.

He thought about it and did it. Quietly, no one was told.

Success may not depend on me. But dependent origination must be with me.

Why wait until the sun rises and the bags are packed. Taking advantage of the hazy night, set off when it is at dark.

Many people are discouraged and disappointed with the current Bitcoin. Complaining about this bear market, complaining about the plummeting prices, complaining that Bitcoin is not a risk-hedge asset, whatever.

They complain about the coldness of the night and the darkness of the night.

They were just wrong.

A bear market is a good opportunity to build a position. Almost all gains in the bull market come from positions established in the bear market.

If you don't open a position in a bear market, do you have to wait until the bull market and be FOMO to catch up?

In the darkest night, there is also a bright white moonlight, and mischievous blinking stars hang all over the sky, like black velvet covered with diamonds, which is intoxicating.

When I stood north of the Arctic Circle, breathing the freezing air of minus 40 degrees, looking up at the dark and vast universe full of stars, I continued to set off and walk the road under my feet.

Walking during the day, walking and walking, it will be dark. Walking at night, walking and walking, the sky is bright.

From day to night, and from night to day. From one day to one night, and from one night to another day.

Do not be infatuated with the joys of the day, nor the sorrows of the night.

There is no shortage of momentary infatuation in this world, but long-term companionship.

I keep walking and walking. We are walking together, walking. More of us are walking together, walking.

Waling to make a new world.
