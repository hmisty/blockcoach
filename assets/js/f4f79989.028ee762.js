My supervisor said that my communication skills were not good enough to handle VIP clients, so I was assigned to the customer service department to deal with retail investors. Although these retail investors don't have much money, they often use high leverage. They either frequently get liquidated with high leverage or follow the trend to buy high and sell low, buying at the high point and selling at the low point, losing everything in the process. Many people become complacent after earning a little money, thinking that they have exceptional abilities. But when they lose everything, they blame others and are difficult to deal with. After a few days, my supervisor said that I couldn't handle the job. Fortunately, the mentor who recommended me for the internship and the major shareholder of the company are old classmates and buddies, so I couldn't be fired. Instead, I was assigned to the mundane task of collecting user feedback."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"From then on, I spent all day in the community, focused on my duties. Although I didn't make any mistakes, I felt that it was somewhat monotonous and boring. My supervisor had an overly shrewd face, and users were constantly fighting in the group, making it very frustrating. Only when Kong Yiji entered the group to speak could I laugh a few times and relax, so I still remember it to this day."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'Kong Yiji was the only person who could wear Armani while opening small positions. He was not tall, had a pale complexion, and his face always looked as if he hadn\'t washed it in weeks. His hair was a mess, resembling a bird\'s nest. Although he wore Armani, his clothes were dirty and old, and seemed to have not been changed or washed in two or three years. When he spoke, he always used F-words, making people frown. Because his surname was Kong, people gave him a nickname from a trending topic on the internet: "Will Kong Yiji wear a changshan or not?" They called him Kong Yiji. Whenever Kong Yiji entered the group, all the people who were arguing would stop and greet him, sending him emojis and some would say, "Kong Yiji, did you blow your position again?" He would not answer, but instead post a screenshot of his trading record showing a profit percentage of a few hundred percent. They would then deliberately shout loudly, "Congratulations on being promoted to the 5u War God!" Kong Yiji would make a wide-eyed expression and say, "Why do you falsely accuse me like that?" "What pale complexion? I saw you change a few u the day before yesterday." Kong Yiji remained silent for a while and argued, "5u is also u... 5u!... When it comes to trading, what matters is the rate of return, can you look at the amount?" This was followed by a string of incomprehensible words, such as "long and short double explosions" and "alpha," which made everyone laugh: the group was filled with a happy atmosphere both inside and outside.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"According to rumors, it was said that Kong Yiji used to have some Bitcoin, but he eventually lost it because he didn't know when to buy low and sell high. He continued to speculate and became poorer and poorer, eventually borrowing money to speculate. Luckily, he had gained some popularity online and could shout out some orders for his backers in exchange for a meal. Unfortunately, he had a bad habit of not knowing when to stop. After a few days, he lost everything, including the principal and interest. After repeating this several times, he had no more backers to lend him money. Kong Yiji had no choice but to do some shameful things. However, on our platform, his conduct was better than others. He was willing to accept his losses when he lost a bet. Although he often lost all his money, he never blamed the platform for manipulating prices. Within ten days to two weeks, he would come back to make trades with renewed vigor."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'At that time, I could also join in and tease him a bit, and the supervisor would not blame me for it. In fact, whenever the supervisor saw Kong Yiji, he would often tease him in the same way and make everyone laugh. Kong Yiji knew he couldn\'t chat with the other members, so he had to talk to me. One time, he @ me, "Have you traded cryptocurrencies before?" I replied with a nodding emoji. He said, "You have traded cryptocurrencies... Let me test you. How should we operate when we \'hoard\' bitcoins?" I thought, how can someone who has gone bankrupt from trading cryptocurrencies test me? So I pretended not to see it and ignored him. Kong Yiji waited for a long time and then said earnestly, "You don\'t know?... Let me teach you, remember these methods. You will need them for an AMA when you become a CEO." I secretly thought to myself that I was far from being a CEO and that our CEO never talked about hoarding bitcoins. Feeling amused and impatient, I lazily replied, "Who needs your teaching? Isn\'t it just buying and holding for the long term?" Kong Yiji appeared very happy, repeatedly sending emojis of thumbs up, applause, and nodding, and then said, "Yes, that\'s it!... There are four methods of hoarding bitcoins, do you know them?" I became even more impatient, and just sent a pouting emoji before going offline. Kong Yiji had just started to explain how to buy low and sell high, and how to avoid market crashes, but seeing my lack of interest, he sighed and showed a very regretful expression.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'Sometimes, people from other social groups heard about the fun in this group and came to chat with Kong Yiji.
